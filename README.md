# PasswordGeneratorwithGUI
Personal project, not from a tutorial 

I created a Pysimple GUI interface for the Password Generator. It asks for the site name and the number of characters needed, between 6 and 10.
Once a password is created, it is saved to a SQLite database.
The GUI also allows you to search the database for previously generated passwords.
Newly created or or searched-for passwords are automatically saved to the clipboard, to make them easy to use.

his was my first 'real' project, developed by myself rather than based on a tutorial. I started with some basic code, adapted it to use OOP, then learned how to use PySimpleGUI for the interface.
